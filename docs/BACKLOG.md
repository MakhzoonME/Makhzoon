## 🔴 Needs attention — CI / known bugs

- **GitHub Actions minutes exhausted until July 1, 2026.** Deploy manually from local machine using the commands in `CLAUDE.md`. CI will resume automatically on July 1.

## 🟡 Planned — not yet built

### 1. Banna — WorkspaceProfile
`WorkspaceProfile` is exported from `lib/modules/banna/types/index.ts` as a placeholder (`id`, `organizationId`, `spaceId`) but is not used anywhere yet. Flesh it out when the workspace-level config concept is defined.

### 3. Banna — Phase 1: Foundation
Prerequisites: items 1 & 2 above must be done first.
- Flesh out `WorkspaceProfile` (business type, industry, size, use cases) — DB migration + service + API
- Banna overview becomes a real dashboard: active modules, profile completeness, quick actions
- Module visibility panel: owner sees which modules are on/off within their subscription
- Self-service module activation: owners can toggle on modules already in `subscription.features`; locked modules shown as "available to upgrade"
- Industry-based custom field templates (pre-built sets for retail, logistics, school, clinic, etc.) — one-click apply

### 4. Banna — Phase 2: Guided Setup Wizard (no AI)
- Step-by-step form wizard: business type → module selection → custom field template → done
- Onboarding trigger: shown to new spaces before any configuration exists
- Re-runnable from Banna overview ("Reconfigure workspace")

### 5. Banna — Phase 3: AI Wizard (Claude API)
- Conversational setup flow using Claude API
- Open-ended interview ("I run a small electronics shop with 3 branches") → auto-configure
- AI-generated custom field suggestions based on business type + existing usage
- Ongoing recommendations surfaced in Banna overview

### 6. Haraka — Card Terminal: live sandbox verification
Paymob, SumUp, and Square providers are fully wired (Paymob 4-step auth/order/payment_key/pay flow fixed). End-to-end verification against each provider's live sandbox still needs real API credentials and a physical terminal.

## ✅ Recently completed
